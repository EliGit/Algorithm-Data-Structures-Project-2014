TiraLabra2013 - Comparison of Dijkstra, A* and Jump Point Search on uniform-cost grid maps
=============================

LosAlgoritmos - a Java pathfinding library for pathfinding in 2D grids. Contains Dijkstra, A* and Jump Point Search algorithms with Manhattan, Chebyshev (Diagonal with Sqrt(2) and equal costs) and Euclidean heuristics.

Input: char[][] matrices with '.' as walkable vertices and anything else as non-walkable. Directly supports .map files from [here](http://movingai.com/benchmarks/). Contains a simple UI for visual testing. Extensive jUnit tests. JavaDoc in English.
